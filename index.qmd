## Biography

I am from Venezuela and currently living in Mexico. My research interests focus on quantitative community ecology, specifically, the description of patterns of species diversity of marine-coastal ecosystems at different spatial scales (from local to continental) and identifying processes responsible for those patterns using correlative analysis and manipulative experiments. My work uses and applies advanced statistical methods to evaluate ecological hypotheses. I am also interested in designing and evaluating statistical methods for better ecological studies; this has opened the doors for several international collaborations, including my current academic affiliation at the [National Autonomous University of Mexico](http://enesmerida.unam.mx/#/investigacion), and professional memberships with the New Zealand company [PRIMER-e](https://www.primer-e.com/about/) and the Mexican company [BS-STATS](www.bs-stats.com).
